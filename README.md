# Algorithms
Implementing and testing algorithms, mostly from Sedgewick and Wayne (2011)

Each folder contains a handful of implementations, plus an example of a nontrivial application.

- Quick find/quick union are dynamic connectivity algorithms that can be used to estimate the percolation threshold for large square lattices
- Mergesort can be used to find sets of collinear points in a plane
- The A* search algorithm, using a priority queue, can be used to solve slider puzzles
